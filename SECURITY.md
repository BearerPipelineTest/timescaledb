# Security Policy

We aim to keep TimescaleDB safe for everyone. 
Publicly disclosing bugs in a public forum puts everyone in the Timescale community at risk.

## Supported Versions

The supported version is always the latest major release available in our repository.
We also release regular minor versions with fixes and corrections alongside some new features as well as patchfix releases, that you should keep upgrading to.
Vulnerability fixes are made available as part of these patchfix releases.
